The dataset used as input can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/googleai/pfam-seed-random-split)

The objective of this study is to build a model linking a protein (amino acid sequence) to its protein family (PFam). 
The description of the problem, the hypotheses and the approach of the study are summarised in the document Report_PFAM.pdf. 

**NOTE :** Concerning the report, beware, the test set has been used to build an imbalance indicator. This can be seen as data leakage, this indicator should be used cacrefully.
